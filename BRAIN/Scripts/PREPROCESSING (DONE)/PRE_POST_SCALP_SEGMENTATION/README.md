Flap segmentation is done for pre/post-operative MRI files that already have scalp extracted from SINGLE_SET_ANALYSIS/Python(DRAFT)/single_set_scalp_and_brain.py.

The purpose is to make a list of clustered files, each predicting a flap region, so that practitioners can pick the most accurate file to use as ground truth.
