This repository contains all files for the project. Archives are not uploaded due to limited memory space.

To satisfy numba-enabled GPU processing and pip3 package installment, the code should be operated in conda environment with pip installed (usually by default). 

Python is recommended to be 3.9.1 or above so as to make sure the packages are workable. pip3 commands should be replaced with pip in case the default python is labeled 'python' with pip as 'pip'.

Currently simplifying codes into functions to enable numba-supported GPU processing.
